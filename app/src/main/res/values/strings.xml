    <string name="about_text">This app allows you to conveniently measure your blood glucose level from an image of your Regulators colorimetric test strip. Line up the blue splotch with the on-screen markers and tap the Analyze button. If the estimate seems reasonable, tap Save.</string>
    <string name="about_text_2">For optimal results, perform scan in a well-lit area, without shadows. A white, evenly colored sheet of paper should be used as the test strip, and the region behind the test strip should also be uniformly white.</string>
    <string name="about_text_3">This app was created by The Regulators, a group of Cooper Union students, for the engineering design class. More information can be found about this product at our website: https://theregulators.github.io.</string>
